## Computational Neuroscience

## Hubel & Wiesel (1965)
They discovered orientation-tuned cells which response to bar of light at specified angles.

## on-center, off-surround receptive fields
These cells respond when center of cell is stimulated 

## off-center, on-surround receptive fileds
These cells repond which sorrounding area is activated

## Examples
- Oriented RF: V1
- Center-surround RF: LGN and retian

- Retina --> LGN --> V1
- number of LGN cells converge to a single v1 cell

## Pre-synaptice neuron
- a neuron that fires the neruotransmitter as a result of action potential

## Post-synaptic neuron
- a neuron that receives the neurotransmitter and may experience and action potential

- A transmitter can influence the function of a neuron.
  - It can influence trans-membrance ion flow either to increase (excitatory) or to decrease (inhibitatory) the probability that a cell which it comes in contact will produce an action potential
