Mais il vient toujours une heure dans l'histoire où celui qui ose dire que deux et deux font quatre est puni de mort. L'instituteur le sait bien. Et la question n'est pas de savoir quelle est la récompense ou la punition qui attend ce raisonnement. La question est de savoir si deux et deux, oui ou non, font quatre.

La peste, Albert Camus (1913 - 1960)

.....................................

But again and again there comes a time in history when the man who dares to say that two and two make four is punished with death. The schoolteacher is well aware of this. And the question is not one of knowing what punishment or reward attends the making of this calculation. The question is one of knowing whether two and two do make four.

Albert Camus, The Plague

"I stopped pretending to myself that I was anything other than what I was..."

 

As most will attest... life is not easy. It's full of peaks and valleys, good and bad, people that give up or give in... and those who keep moving forward over and around any obstacles no matter what setbacks are encountered.

 

To succeed sometimes you have to break things down, tear them down, beat them down so you can rebuild something better--something that is right for you. As Kipling put it, "...stoop and build... with worn-out tools...".

 

Or as J.K. Rowling so aptly puts in the following (and watch the video for her full speech on the subject):

 

“…why do I talk about the benefits of failure? Simply because failure meant a stripping away of the inessential. I stopped pretending to myself that I was anything other than what I was, and began to direct all my energy into finishing the only work that mattered to me. Had I really succeeded at anything else, I might never have found the determination to succeed in the one arena I believed I truly belonged. I was set free, because my greatest fear had been realised, and I was still alive, and I still had a daughter whom I adored, and I had an old typewriter and a big idea. And so rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life." --J.K. Rowling

 

"It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all – in which case, you fail by default."--J.K. Rowling

 

I stopped pretending to myself that I was anything other than what I was, and began to direct all my energy into finishing the only work that mattered to me.

 

 

Failure gave me an inner security that I had never attained by passing examinations. Failure taught me things about myself that I could have learned no other way. I discovered that I had a strong will, and more discipline than I had suspected; I also found out that I had friends whose value was truly above the price of rubies.

 

 

It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all – in which case, you fail by default.

You were wild once, don't let them tame you.

We live in an increasingly cynical age where romantic love has been distilled into algorithms of data, where love is reduced to nothing more than an addiction runs through your neurotransmitter rather than heart, biochemically no different than an addiction to cocaine. Imagine that, right? The romantic passion of the lover, reduced to selfishness. There’s something kind of cynical about this resignation, about letting go of that ecstasy of love that inspired the Romeo and Juliet story, where we lose ourselves and put the lover on a pedestal. We easily get moved to tenderness and beauty, but those in between times, those moments of pillow talks, calling baby names to each other, treating each other like children, promising future to each other, those cuddling, those holding hands and kissing each other, wrapping arms around each other’s shoulders and getting closed as much as possible, these moments, these exchanges, these intimacies, these moments of consummation, and that promise, I think, keeps us searching and keeps us chronically dissatisfied, we will not settle, we will not let go of that romantic dream, of that moment, of that tenderness, of that goosebumps. Can you blame us for squeezing so tightly around one another? Can you blame us for wanting to listen to beautiful music and cry together? Can you blame us for wanting to seek out comfort in each other’s cold soul space and to say, “Please tell me you’ll not leave me, you will not disappear, I will not be alone”? You know, that’s what we want, that’s what we seek. And then they say, “Oh we are co-dependent, we’re weak. We should be Independent.” But come on man, it’s eco-delic, it’s all interconnected, we are all one, we’re not alone. It is okay to be co-dependent. It is not a bad thing.

But this addiction of romantic love always results in a heartbreak. I believe that we are all wounded. I believe that we are all bleeding. I think the reason that in romantic context we are attracted to others who are wounded is because we feel that by saving them, we in turn save ourselves, right? Romantic love is a perfect consummation with perfection itself. We are purged in these instances in which we find another eyes we will be reflected and saved, right? This notion that we will see ourselves being seen by another who bestows us with light. But ultimately, the crux of the human condition is the perhaps tragic realization that you can’t save the ones you love. Those wounded birds, the manic pixie dream girl, you can’t save her. So what does that mean? It means if you can’t even save the ones you love, how can you save yourself, right? This is the tragedy of the human condition. This is the sad song that gives you the goosebumps and makes you cry. This is the lyric that makes you tear up. It is the acknowledgement of something that aches, something that is, of something that we wish was not the case. There is beauty in this tragedy, but first let us acknowledge the tragedy of it, and then we can keep the holy memory by saying, it happened. We exist. We felt something.

Be careful of what and what you believe in. Find someone that you love fiercely. And who loves you back the same way. And you treat them well. And you know it's of value. Also, you shouldn't be scare of the world it was. I kind of suspect the world should be scare of you.
